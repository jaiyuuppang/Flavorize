When it reaches a medium high heat, add the shallots and garlic and saut for a minute. Add the sprouts, cook until they are browned and become a little softer ( not too soft though, you dont want them to be mushy, but to retain a little bite).  You can probably get going with cooking the pasta when the sprouts are nearly finished.  Just follow the instructions on the packet for timings.  The best way to cook pasta is to put it into a pan with plenty of boiling water and a good helping of salt. When the sprouts are cooked, move them to the outside area of the pan and add the bacon to the centre, allowing it to cook for a couple of minutes, turning a couple of times. When the bacon is cooked, mix it through the sprouts and give a good grind of black pepper and a little salt.  Careful with salt as the bacon and the parmesan will also add a salty flavour. When the pasta is ready, bring your two pans close together on the stove.  Then, with tongs, grab the pasta and drag is swiftly into the pan with the sprouts.  By doing this you take in some of the pasta water.  This water helps bind and create your sauce.  You dont need  much, in this case probably about 2 tablespoons worth.  This dragging technique should ensure that you have enough. Turn the heat off under your sprouts and pasta. Add the egg (not directly on to the base of the pan but onto the pasta mixture) add the parmesan.  Stir through quite quickly, this will create a creamy style sauce. Check for seasoning, and serve immediately with some extra parmesan sprinkled over the top if you wish. This works well with all sorts of pasta.  The only type that doesnt work so well for a carbonara style dish is whole meal or gluten free varieties.  These pastas seem to lack the starchy constituent that gives your sauce that creamy texture.

Peel, deseed, and cut butternut squash in 1/4” cubes. Cook butternut squash cubes for 10 minutes. Drain and roughly mash with a fork, season with curry powder, and set aside. Place pan back on burner and melt butter over medium heat. Cook shallots until translucent (and delicious smelling), about 2 minutes. Add olive oil, wait a minute for it to heat up, then add rice and garlic, and constantly stir for 1 minute. Add mushrooms and stir for another minute. Now is a good time to season with salt and pepper, but be careful...the stock contains salt, the cheese is salty, and the butternut squash was cooked in salt water. If you want to be safe, only season at the very end before serving. Add one cup of stock and stir occasionally until most of the liquid is absorbed. Then, add second cup of stock and stir occasionally until most of the liquid is absorbed. Add mashed butternut squash, cheese, and herbs, stir, and add remaining stock. Keep stirring, and after a total rice cooking time of about 20 minutes, the rice should be al dente and you’ll have a creamy, fantastic smelling risotto that can&#x27;t wait to be served on pre-warmed dishes. Garnish with herbs and some more cheese, if you like. Then sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.
